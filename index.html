						<div class="left-text small">
							A self-adaptive system can modify its own structure and behaviour at runtime based on its
							perception of the environment, of itself and of its requirements. By adapting itself at
							runtime,
							the system can maintain its requirements in the presence of dynamic environment changes.
							Examples are elastic cloud systems, intelligent IoT systems as well as proactive process
							management systems. To develop a self-adaptive system, software engineers must encode when
							and
							how the system should adapt itself. However, in doing so, software engineers face the
							challenge
							of design time uncertainty. Among other concerns, this requires anticipating the potential
							environment situations the system may encounter at runtime to define when the system should
							adapt itself. Yet, anticipating all potential environment situations is in most cases
							infeasible
							due to incomplete information at design time. As a further concern, the precise effect of an
							adaptation action may not be known at design time and thus accurately determining how the
							system
							should adapt itself is difficult. This talk will explore the opportunities but also
							challenges
							that modern machine learning algorithms offer in building self-adaptive systems in the
							presence
							of design time uncertainty. It will focus on online reinforcement learning as an emerging
							approach to realize self-adaptive systems. Online reinforcement learning means that during
							operation the system learns from interactions with its environment, thereby effectively
							leveraging data only available at run time.

								The importance of anomaly detection in manufacturing, resulting in good quality
								end-products while reducing process downtime and consequently increasing efficiency, is
								undeniable. In this spirit, we compare the predicting power of a bouquet of
								(anomaly-detecting) artificial intelligence models and propose their combined use in
								order to (i) make use of their combined predicting power while (ii) minimizing the
								chance of an individual model leaves some anomaly types undetected. Specifically, we
								study the in-parallel performance of ARIMA, LSTM and Dense-based autoencoders, as well
								as GAN models on the virtual CNC milling machine in the System-level Manufacturing &
								Automation Tested (SMART), comparing their performance in detecting tool wear anomalies
								using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. This work is in-progress; in the
								future we aim to apply said models on actual manufacturing data provided by two large
								industry actors, focusing on specific user cases and accounting for well-defined data
								quality issues in manufacturing. Moreover, these techniques will be extended to
								multivariate approaches in order to serve the complex requirements of the manufacturing
								industry.

								<p>The International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) is a coalition of more than 130
									member
									companies that share a vision of a world where all companies self-determine usage
									rules
									and realize the full value of their data in secure, trusted, equal partnerships; and
									we
									are making that vision a reality.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our goal is nothing less than a global standard for international data spaces (IDS)
									and
									interfaces, as well as fostering the related technologies and business models that
									will
									drive the data economy of the future across industries.
								</p>
								<p>
									Data is rapidly becoming business’s most valuable asset — but it can only deliver on
									its
									full value when you put it into use and share it in ways that you, as the data
									provider,
									determine and control. International data spaces (IDS) are where this kind of
									trustworthy, self-determined exchange can happen, and our Reference Architecture
									Model
									(IDS-RAM) sets the standard for building data-driven ecosystems, products and
									services.
								</p>
								<p>
									Because of the correlation between good data quality and maximizing the value of
									data as
									an economic good, the International Data Spaces explicitly addresses the aspect of
									data
									quality. As described in the IDS Reference Architecture Model, several mechanisms
									contribute to ensuring that the data being shared in an IDS ecosystem meets the
									expected

								<p>
									Representative sampling is an important basis for acquiring high quality data.
									Depending
									on the actual type of process and the objectives with the subsequent data analysis,
									sampling has many facets. Design of Experiments (DoE) plays an important role in
									planning the most effective sampling scheme, where the optimal balance between time,
									effort and representative data is pursued.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the case of providing quantitative predictions in a system, one main challenge is
									to
									acquire representative samples both in time and for the given physical dimensions of
									raw
									materials, intermediate products from various steps in the process, and final
									products.
									The quality of the reference data is imperative for deploying precise and accurate
									models in such environments
								</p>
								<p>
									For condition monitoring and predictive maintenance, how to represent future (more
									or
									less known) out-of-control situations from a subset of the vast amount of data is
									one of
									the key issues. Other important aspects are strategies for sampling in continuous,
									semi-batch and batch processes respectively, herein optimal sampling frequency and
									alignment of data in the case of sensor fusion and multiblock models.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sampling is also the basis for setting up correct schemes for model validation. The
									often-used approach of dividing randomly into a training and test set has shown to
									be
									suboptimal in most practical applications. The main reason is that there will for
									all
									real processes be reasons to stratify the samples due to time, batches of raw
									material,
									sensors, production lines and differences in operation of the process (the human
									factor). Thus. the validation scheme must be conservative for not being too
									optimistic
									in the training phase. Unfortunately, the true performance of the model can only be
									assessed after being deployed for a representative period of time. To rephrase a
									well-known proverb: “The proof of the model lies in the prediction”. Typical
									examples
									are prediction error and classification accuracy for quantitative and qualitative
									models, respectively. Also at this stage, representative sampling is critical for
									correct assessment of the model’s performance.
								</p>
								<p>
									The presentation will give examples of the many challenges pertaining to sampling
									for
									various types of processes and the subsequent deployment of models for prediction.

							<div class="card card-body">
								Future ship owners and operators will use more sensors collected from the Vessel
								Performance Management System to measure their operations and use the data to enhance
								their operations. These vessels' IoT data will be extracted, loaded, transformed, and
								ultimately made available to end-users via a data serving pipeline. As NYK collects this
								data, it understands that data quality and reliability are essential, as many
								applications have been or will be built using this data, both internally and for
								customers. As data quality issues appeared frequently, the function of the data quality
								management system becomes of utmost necessity. Therefore, NYK and its group company MTI
								have developed a prototype of the NYK-DQMS (Data Quality Management System), which
								incorporates the business objective into a system that can be used by internal
								stakeholders, to assess, monitor, analyze and communicate to solve the issues while
								referring to various international standards and practical guidelines. The DQMS is
								positioned to replace ad-hoc data quality monitoring activities on 200 SIMS-equipped
								ships and is the backbone of NYK's digital quality assurance vision, which is already
								physically realized in the form of a remote diagnostic center. By introducing the DQMS
								to our land-based system, we hope to quickly identify anomalies in data quality
								indicators and shorten the response time to prevent problems from recurring. The system
								prototype being trialed has already identified some interesting issues and is a
								compelling tool for raising awareness of the importance of IoT data quality management
								at all stakeholder levels.

								Context: IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been developed in many industrial
								sectors
								and
								application domains in which the quality of the data acquired and used for decision

								Goals: We aim to assess the existing efforts to address the data quality issues of the

								Method: We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify 50 primary
								studies from thousands of relevant publications for in-depth analysis.
								Results: We have extracted and synthesized data from the primary studies to answer our
								predefined research questions. Some highlights from the results of our SLR show that
								data quality is often neglected even though it is very important, e.g., in data
								preparation for the analysis or utilisation of data sets in a machine learning
								framework. Many of the reviewed papers propose methods that indirectly handle data
								quality, although they generally covered project results, and do not necessarily reflect
								industry best practice in a wider sense. Data quality requirements only discussed in
								several papers and were predefined or used reference data, whilst quite a few of the
								papers applied statistical monitoring of data to discover data quality issues. The
								majority of the identified use cases and research are conducted in a controlled research
								environment rather than implemented and validated in a real industrial setting.
								Conclusions: Based on the results, we suggest some potential research directions to
								address the gaps found.

					<h2>Call for Presentation Abstracts</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="left-text">
					<p>
						SEA4DQ 2021 accepts the following types of contributions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Presentation Abstracts</b> that will be around 250-500 words long (and presentation
							files/short papers if possible) and authors will give presentations at the workshop about
							<b>(i)</b> research results that are either already published or early research results not
							yet
							published; and <b>(ii)</b> industrial talks. This new track aims at stimulating the
							participation
							of industrial practitioners - who will be able to present the practices used in their
							contexts - as well as researchers - who may be interested in receiving feedback from the
							research community on early ideas.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Please submit the abstracts (and if possible, papers/presentation files in PDF format) on
						EasyChair.
					</p>
					<p>
						The abstract will only be reviewed by the program committee for relevance, and
						will not be included in the SEA4DQ proceedings, but the abstracts (and presentations) will
						be made available on the website of the workshop.
					</p>
