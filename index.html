							<h2>About SEA4DQ</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8 mx-auto">
								<p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS)/Internet of Things (IoT) are omnipresent in many
									industrial sectors and
									application domains in which the quality of the data
									acquired and used for decision support is a common factor. Data quality can
									deteriorate due to factors such as sensor faults
									and failures due to operating in harsh and uncertain environments.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><i>How can software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI)
											help manage and tame data quality issues in CPS/IoT? </i></b>
								</p>
								<p>
									This is the question we aim to investigate in this workshop SEA4DQ.
									Emerging trends in software engineering need to take data quality management
									seriously as CPS/IoT are increasingly data-centric in
									their approach to acquiring and processing data along the edge-fog-cloud continuum.
									This workshop will provide researchers and
									practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the
									problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions
									to the problems in data quality in CPS/IoT.

				</header>
				<div class="left-text">
					<p>
						SEA4DQ 2022 accepts the following types of contributions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Position Papers</b> (max. 2 pages) that analyze trends in data quality for CPS/IoT and
							raise
							issues of importance. Position papers are intended to generate discussion and debate during
							the
							workshop, and will be reviewed with respect to relevance and their ability to start up
							fruitful
							discussions;
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Work-in-progress Papers</b> (max. 4 pages) that describe novel, interesting, and highly
							potential work in progress, but not necessarily reaching its full completion;
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Full Papers</b> (max. 10 pages) describing original and completed research
							-- either empirical or theoretical -- in techniques, tools, or industrial case studies;
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Tool Papers/Demos/Posters</b> (max. 4 pages) presenting some tools/demos/posters that are
							related to data quality;
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Presentation Abstracts</b> that that will be around 250-500 words long (and presentation
							files if possible).
							If accepted, authors will give presentations at the workshop about
							<b>(i)</b> research results that are either already published or early research results not
							yet
							published; and <b>(ii)</b> industrial talks. This new track aims at stimulating the
							participation
							of industrial practitioners - who will be able to present the practices used in their
							contexts - as well as researchers - who may be interested in receiving feedback from the
							research community on early ideas. The abstract will only be reviewed by the program
							committee for relevance, and
							will not be included in the workshop proceedings.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Submission Format: <a target="_blank"

						<!--Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. 
						Submitted papers must not have been previously published and must not be under review or submission for review anywhere at the time of submission.-->
					</p>
					<p>
						The accepted papers will be published in the workshop's proceedings (will be proposed for
						publication in the ACM digital library).
						As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all <a

						<h3 class="left-text">Title: "Online Reinforcement Learning for Self-adaptive Systems"</h3>
						<div class="left-text small">
							A self-adaptive system can modify its structure and behavior at runtime based on its
							perception of the environment, itself, and its requirements. By adapting itself at runtime,
							the system can maintain its requirements in the presence of dynamic environment changes.
							Examples are elastic cloud systems, intelligent IoT systems as well as proactive process
							management systems.

							One key element of a self-adaptive system is its self-adaptation logic that encodes when and
							how the system should adapt itself. When developing the adaptation logic, developers face
							the challenge of design time uncertainty. To define when the system should adapt, they have
							to anticipate all potential environment states. However, this is infeasible in most cases
							due to incomplete information at design time. As an example, the concrete services that may
							be dynamically bound during the execution of a service-oriented system and thus their
							quality characteristics are typically not known at design time. To define how the system
							should adapt itself, developers need to know the precise effect an adaptation action has.
							However, the precise
							effect may not be known at design time. As an example, while developers may know in
							principle that enabling more features will negatively influence the performance, exactly
							determining the performance impact is more challenging. A recent industrial survey
							determined optimal design and
							design complexity together with design-time uncertainty to be among the most frequently
							observed difficulties in designing self-adaptation logic in practice.

							This talk will explore the opportunities but also challenges that modern machine learning
							algorithms offer in building the self-adaptation logic in the presence of design-time
							uncertainty. It will focus on online reinforcement learning as an emerging approach, which
							means that during operation the system learns from interactions with its environment,
							thereby effectively leveraging data only available at run time. In particular, the talk will
							introduce our solutions for (1) coping with large discrete adaptation spaces, and (2)
							handling non-stationary environments. The talk will close with a critical discussion of
							limitations and an outlook on future research opportunities.
